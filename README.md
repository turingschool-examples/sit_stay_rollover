# Sit, Stay, Roll Over

## Intro
This repository is meant to help you practice with nested collections. Animals have skills, that may or may not be party tricks and households can have many pets. The tests for all three classes are written for you. You should be using TDD to help you iterate through your objects and their collections and return what is expected in the tests.

## Preparation

* Clone this repository onto local computer
* Use TDD to make the following tests pass in this exact order:
  - `animal_test.rb`
  - `household_test.rb`
